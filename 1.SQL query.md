four tables are used in this analysis: 
1.	‘Restaurants attributes’ table to get restaurant id, name, city, city id and its area name
2.	‘Plus ’ table to get item id and tag (tag has two categories plus and not plus)
3.	‘Items’ table to get food item name
4.	‘Serviceability’ table to get availability > 0.75 ( i.e restaurant is open 75% of its ideal time)

‘Serviceability’ table has features : rest id ,actual open time, ideal open time and date.
Availability of rest from serviceability table is obtained by dividing total duration of actual open time to the total duration of  ideal open time and applying filter on date for one week. Here we get data in terms of true or false based on its 75% availability.
